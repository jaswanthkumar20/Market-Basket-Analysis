# Market-Basket-Analysis

Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is a data mining technique that analyzes customer purchase patterns by examining transactions to uncover relationships between products frequently bought together. By identifying these associations, businesses can:

1.Optimize Product Placement: Arrange related items closer to each other in stores or online platforms to encourage additional purchases.

2.Enhance Cross-Selling: Develop targeted marketing strategies to suggest complementary products based on what customers typically buy together.

3.Improve Inventory Management: Forecast demand more accurately by understanding which items are likely to be purchased together.

4.Personalize Marketing: Tailor promotions and discounts to individual shopping habits, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.

This analysis is typically conducted using algorithms like Apriori or FP-Growth, which generate association rules showing which products are frequently co-purchased and in what combinations.
